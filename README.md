## Jam Utility 

#### Jam Utility is a helper tool for musicians to use when writing or playing music, either alone or together. 
Have a riff or melody and want to know what other material might work well with it? 
Jam Utility creates and filters a library of musical scales. Select the notes in your riff or melody, and Jam Utility will tell you which musical scales contain those notes! It will display all the notes within each matching scale, as well as the common chords built from that scale. Nice!

#### Jam Utility's musical knowledge. 
Jam Utility currently "knows" the major and minor scales as well as the other five greek modes: Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolyian, and Locrian. It can represent all of these scales/modes with all possible root notes, which means Jam Utility can show 77 unfilitered scales currently. 

#### Tech Stack
The current version of Jam Utility is a Blazor WebAssembly App, built on .NET 8. It uses Bootstrap as a style library. 
The original V1 version of Jam Utility was a React app - it can be found in the Jam-Utility-V1-React branch.
