#### Jam Utility is a helper tool for musicians to use when writing or playing music, either alone or together. 
Have a riff, lick, or melody and want to know what other material might work well with it? 
Jam Utility references a library of musical scales. Select the notes in your riff or melody, and Jam Utility will tell you which musical scales contain those notes!

*Jam Utility is a work in progress! It doesn't contain every scale out there and, let's be honest, it isn't very pretty. I'm building it as a way to learn React!*
